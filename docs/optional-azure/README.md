Optional Azure deployment guides (moved)

This folder contains guides and workflow examples for deploying the prototype to Azure resources.

They are intentionally moved out of the main docs to keep the 'no-Azure' fork and instructions clean. Use these guides only if you want to deploy the Node backend to Azure App Service or the static site to Azure Static Web Apps.

Files moved here:
- `azure-ad-setup.md` — Azure AD application registration
- `deploy-node.md` — Deploy the Node backend to Azure App Service
- `deploy-static.md` — Deploy static prototype files to Azure Static Web Apps

If you are deploying the portal in a Microsoft 365 tenant with SharePoint Online + Power Automate + Power BI, you do NOT need any of these Azure resources.
